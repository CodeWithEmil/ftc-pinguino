This repository contains the FTC code for my team's INTO THE DEEP (2024-2025) competition robot.

The goal was to make the code the most understandable and easy to follow.

That's why I made sure to define a clear code hierarchy, including systems, subsystems and their respective configurations stored in several files.

It has got several comments explaining in detail the complete thought process as well as basic stuff to make it beginner friendly too.
